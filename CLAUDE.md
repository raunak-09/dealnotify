## Compare Feature — Summary (added 2026-04-17)

The Compare feature lets users see if an Amazon product they are viewing is available cheaper at Walmart. It runs automatically on Amazon PDPs via the Chrome extension and shows a panel with the Walmart price, savings, and a CTA.

### New files created
- `price_comparison.py` — core comparison module: Amazon identity extraction (via Firecrawl), Walmart search (via Firecrawl), LLM matching (Gemini/Anthropic/Groq provider abstraction)

### Files modified
- `web_app.py` — added `product_comparisons` + `comparison_clicks` DB tables, `POST /api/compare` (auth + rate-limit + cache + affiliate wrapping), `POST /api/compare/click` (click tracker), `GET /api/admin/compare-stats`, `wrap_affiliate_link()` helper
- `chrome-extension/manifest.json` — added `https://*.amazon.com/*` to host_permissions; added second content_scripts entry for Amazon PDPs loading comparison-panel.js/css
- `chrome-extension/background.js` — handles `COMPARE_PRODUCT` message, fetches `/api/compare`, forwards `COMPARE_RESULT` to tab
- `chrome-extension/content.js` — `detectAndCompareAmazonPDP()` with `_compareDispatched` guard; sends `COMPARE_PRODUCT` to background; renders panel on `COMPARE_RESULT`

### New extension files
- `chrome-extension/comparison-panel.js` — renders price comparison panel (only for exact/likely confidence); DOM-only, no innerHTML
- `chrome-extension/comparison-panel.css` — styles scoped under `.dealnotify-compare-panel`

### QA bugs fixed (DEA-18, 2026-04-17)
- `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` and `GEMINI_API_KEY` had trailing `\n` in Railway env vars → added `.strip()` to both
- `gemini-2.5-flash` thinking model consumed `maxOutputTokens: 200` budget before emitting any JSON → switched to `gemini-2.0-flash-lite` (no thinking), bumped to `maxOutputTokens: 512`, added JSON extraction regex for prose-wrapped responses
- Added keyword-based fallback scorer (`_score_with_keywords`) that activates when Gemini API is rate-limited or quota-exhausted — uses recall-based token overlap (≥55% → likely, ≥35% → possible)
- `get_user_by_token()` returns tuple `(user, products)` — both compare endpoints had `user, _ =` unpacking added

### v2 queue
- Target and Best Buy retailer integration (stubs exist in `RETAILER_SEARCHERS`)
- `TARGET_AFFILIATE_ID` and `BESTBUY_AFFILIATE_ID` env vars (leave blank for now)
- Rate limit increase based on usage data
- Push notifications for price improvements on tracked products
- Upgrade Gemini API to paid tier to avoid daily quota exhaustion
